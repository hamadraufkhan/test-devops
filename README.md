Agile Vs Devops:
The difference between Agile versus DevOps is that Agile is a philosophy about how to develop and deliver software, while DevOps describes how to continuously deploy code through the use of modern tools and automated processes.


CI/CD:
Continuous integration is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to frequently implement small code changes and check them in to a version control repository. Most modern applications require developing code using a variety of platforms and tools, so teams need a consistent mechanism to integrate and validate changes. Continuous integration establishes an automated way to build, package, and test their applications. Having a consistent integration process encourages developers to commit code changes more frequently, which leads to better collaboration and code quality.

Continuous delivery picks up where continuous integration ends, and automates application delivery to selected environments, including production, development, and testing environments. Continuous delivery is an automated way to push code changes to these environments.

Benifits of cloud computing:
Cost Savings
Security
Flexibility
Mobility
Insight
Increased Collaboration
Quality Control
Disaster Recovery
Loss Prevention
Automatic Software Updates
Competitive Edge
Sustainability


Difference b/w Git & Github:
Git is a software which will be installed in our local system
GitHub is a Software as a service (SaaS) which can be used by millions of people for code saving into cloud platform and access it upon his/her company size.

Stages of Git:
there are 4 stages of git 
working directory - staging - local repo - cloud repository

3 methods of git reset:
soft
soft reset will take back changes from local repo to staged 
mixed
mixed reset will take back changes from local repo to working directory
hard
hard reset will take back changes from local repo to dust bin and you will not be able to revert this change. (be very coutious with that command)
